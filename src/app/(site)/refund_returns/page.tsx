        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Our refund and returns policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have passed
          since your purchase, we can&rsquo;t offer you a full refund or
          exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the
          same condition that you received it. It must also be in the
          original packaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several types of goods are exempt from being returned. Perishable
          goods such as food, flowers, newspapers or magazines cannot be
          returned. We also do not accept products that are intimate or
          sanitary goods, hazardous materials, or flammable liquids or gases.
        </p>
        <p>Additional non-returnable items:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gift cards</li>
          <li>Downloadable software products</li>
          <li>Some health and personal care items</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.</p>
        <p>Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer.</p>
        <p>There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Book with obvious signs of use</li>
          <li>
            CD, DVD, VHS tape, software, video game, cassette tape, or vinyl
            record that has been opened.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any item not in its original condition, is damaged or missing
            parts for reasons not due to our error.
          </li>
          <li>Any item that is returned more than 30 days after delivery</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an
          email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We
          will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a
          credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or
          original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.
        </p>

        <h3>Late or missing refunds</h3>
        <p>If you haven&rsquo;t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.</p>
        <p>Then contact your credit card company; it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.</p>
        <p>Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.</p>
        <p>
          If you&rsquo;ve done all of this and you still have not received
          your refund, please contact us at{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${siteConfig.email}`}>{siteConfig.email}</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Sale items</h3>
        <p>Only regular priced items may be refunded. Sale items cannot be refunded.</p>

        <h2>Exchanges</h2>
        <p>
          We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need
          to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${siteConfig.email}`}>{siteConfig.email}</a> and
          send your item to: {siteConfig.address.line1}, {siteConfig.address.line2}.
        </p>

        <h2>Gifts</h2>
        <p>
          If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped
          directly to you, you&rsquo;ll receive a gift credit for the value of
          your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate
          will be mailed to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the item wasn&rsquo;t marked as a gift when purchased, or the
          gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you
          later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and they will find
          out about your return.
        </p>

        <h2>Shipping returns</h2>
        <p>
          To return your product, you should mail your product to:{" "}
          {siteConfig.address.line1}, {siteConfig.address.line2}.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for
          returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you
          receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from
          your refund.
        </p>
        <p>Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you may vary.</p>
        <p>
          If you are returning more expensive items, you may consider using a
          trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We
          don&rsquo;t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
        </p>
